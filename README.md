# Trello-Like Board Application

A simple, fully functional Trello-like board application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses local storage for data persistence.

## Project Setup Steps

### 1. Directory Creation
```bash
mkdir -p ~/TrelloLike
```
Created the project directory in the user's home folder.

### 2. HTML Structure (`index.html`)
Created the main HTML file with:
- Semantic HTML structure for the board layout
- Three columns: To Do, Doing, and Done
- Modal dialog for adding/editing cards
- Proper accessibility attributes and meta tags
- Links to CSS and JavaScript files

Key HTML elements:
- `.board` container with three `.column` divs
- Each column has a header with title and "Add Card" button
- `.cards-container` for holding individual cards
- Modal overlay with form inputs for card title and description

### 3. CSS Styling (`styles.css`)
Implemented comprehensive styling including:
- Modern gradient background design
- Flexbox layout for responsive columns
- Card styling with hover effects and animations
- Modal dialog styling with overlay
- Drag and drop visual feedback
- Mobile-responsive design with media queries
- Professional color scheme and typography

Key CSS features:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Visual feedback for drag and drop operations
- Professional styling matching modern web applications

### 4. JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)
Built a complete `TrelloBoard` class with the following methods and features:

#### Core Methods:
- `constructor()` - Initialize the board and load saved data
- `loadCards()` - Load cards from localStorage
- `saveCards()` - Save cards to localStorage
- `generateId()` - Create unique IDs for cards
- `initializeEventListeners()` - Set up all event handlers

#### Card Management:
- `openModal(column, card)` - Open modal for adding/editing cards
- `closeModal()` - Close the modal dialog
- `saveCard()` - Save new or edited cards
- `deleteCard(column, cardId)` - Delete cards with confirmation
- `moveCard(cardId, fromColumn, toColumn)` - Move cards between columns

#### UI Rendering:
- `createCardElement(card, column)` - Generate HTML for individual cards
- `renderCards(column)` - Render all cards in a specific column
- `renderAllCards()` - Render cards in all columns
- `addDragDropListeners(container, column)` - Add drag and drop functionality

#### Utility Methods:
- `escapeHtml(text)` - Prevent XSS attacks
- `clearAllData()` - Clear all stored data
- `exportData()` - Export data as JSON file
- `importData(jsonData)` - Import data from JSON

#### Features Implemented:
- **Local Storage Persistence**: All data automatically saved and loaded
- **Drag and Drop**: Move cards between columns with visual feedback
- **Modal Editing**: Click cards to edit title and description
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save, Escape to close modal
- **Data Validation**: Prevent empty cards and validate input
- **Security**: HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### 5. Event Handling Setup
Configured comprehensive event handling for:
- Add card buttons in each column
- Modal open/close interactions
- Card editing and deletion
- Drag and drop operations
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Click outside modal to close

### 6. Data Structure
Implemented a clean data structure stored in localStorage:
```javascript
{
  todo: [
    {
      id: "unique-id",
      title: "Card Title",
      description: "Optional description",
      createdAt: "ISO timestamp",
      updatedAt: "ISO timestamp"
    }
  ],
  doing: [...],
  done: [...]
}
```
