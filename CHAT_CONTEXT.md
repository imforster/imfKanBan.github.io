## Conversation Summary

**Date**: July 8-10, 2025  
**Project**: Trello-Like Board Application with Multiple Board Support  
**Location**: ~/TrelloLike/ → /Users/iforster/1. Projects/imfKanBan.github.io/  

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (July 8, 2025)
User requested help creating a basic Trello board application with:
- Local storage for data persistence
- 3 columns: ToDo, Doing, and Done
- Basic card management functionality

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancements (July 8, 2025)
Added advanced features:
- Search and filter functionality
- Card priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- Due dates with visual indicators
- Enhanced UI with modern styling

### Phase 3: Multiple Board Capability (July 10, 2025)
**Major Enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive multiple board support with:
- Board management interface
- Board creation, deletion, and switching
- Board title editing
- Import/export functionality
- Persistent board selection

## Current Architecture

### 1. BoardManager Class
**Purpose**: Manages multiple boards and board-level operations

**Key Methods**:
- `loadBoards()` / `saveBoards()` - Board persistence
- `createBoard(title)` - Create new boards
- `deleteBoard(boardId)` - Delete boards with validation
- `switchToBoard(boardId)` - Switch between boards
- `exportBoard()` / `importBoard()` - Data import/export
- `updateBoardTitle()` - Board title management

**Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
  'board_id': {
    id: 'board_id',
    title: 'Board Title',
    createdAt: 'ISO timestamp',
    cards: {
      todo: [...],
      doing: [...],
      done: [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced TrelloBoard Class
**Purpose**: Manages cards within the current board context

**Key Enhancements**:
- Integration with BoardManager
- `switchBoard(newCards)` - Handle board switching
- Maintains existing card management functionality
- Search and filter capabilities
- Drag and drop between columns

### 3. UI Components

#### Board Header
- **Board Title**: Editable title with pencil icon
- **Board Selector**: Dropdown to switch between boards
- **Board Controls**: New board, delete board buttons
- **Import/Export**: Data management buttons

#### Modals
- **Board Title Edit Modal**: Edit current board title
- **New Board Modal**: Create new boards
- **Card Modal**: Existing card add/edit functionality

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Board Management
- ✅ **Multiple Boards**: Create, switch, and manage multiple project boards
- ✅ **Board Persistence**: All boards saved to localStorage with unique IDs
- ✅ **Board Title Editing**: Click-to-edit board titles
- ✅ **Board Deletion**: Delete boards with confirmation (protects default board)
- ✅ **Current Board Memory**: Remembers last selected board

### Data Management
- ✅ **Import/Export**: JSON-based board import/export functionality
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Validates imported board structure
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Migrates single-board data to multi-board format

### Enhanced UI
- ✅ **Board Header**: Professional board management interface
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly board controls
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and transitions
- ✅ **Modal Dialogs**: Consistent modal design for board operations

### Existing Features (Maintained)
- ✅ **Card Management**: Add, edit, delete, move cards
- ✅ **Drag & Drop**: Visual card movement between columns
- ✅ **Search & Filter**: Find cards by content, priority, due date
- ✅ **Priorities & Due Dates**: Card metadata with visual indicators
- ✅ **Local Storage**: Automatic data persistence
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save, Escape to close

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Migration Strategy
- Automatically detects single-board data format
- Migrates existing `trelloCards` to multi-board `trelloBoards` structure
- Preserves all existing card data during migration
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Board ID Generation
- Uses timestamp + random string for unique board IDs
- Format: `board_[timestamp][random]`
- Ensures no ID collisions across sessions

### Memory Management
- Efficient board switching without full page reload
- Minimal DOM manipulation during board switches
- Preserves UI state (search terms, filters) across board switches

### Error Handling
- Validates board existence before switching
- Prevents deletion of last remaining board
- Protects default board from deletion
- Graceful handling of corrupted import data

## Development Environment Notes
- User's system: macOS
- Working directory: `/Users/iforster/1. Projects/imfKanBan.github.io/`

- **Event-Driven Design**: Comprehensive event handling system

### Data Management
- **Immutable Operations**: Safe data manipulation patterns
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Persistence**: Automatic saving with localStorage abstraction

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Modal Consistency**: Reusable modal patterns across features
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features work without JavaScript (basic HTML)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Security Considerations
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML escaping for user input
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs
- **Safe Data Handling**: Proper JSON parsing with error handling

## User Preferences Observed

- **Browser Compatibility**: Tested in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Local Storage**: Requires browser localStorage support
- **JavaScript**: Requires ES6+ support for class syntax
- **Drag & Drop**: Requires HTML5 Drag and Drop API support

## Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient DOM Updates**: Minimal re-rendering during board switches
- **Event Delegation**: Optimized event handling
- **Lazy Loading**: Cards rendered only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners
