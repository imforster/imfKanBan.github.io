## Conversation Summary

**Date**: July 8, 2025  
**Project**: Trello-Like Board Application  
**Location**: ~/TrelloLike/  

## Initial Request
User requested help creating a basic Trello board application with:
- Local storage for data persistence
- 3 columns: ToDo, Doing, and Done
- Basic card management functionality

## Development Process

### 1. Project Setup
- Initially started in `/Volumes/workplace/AxdbJavaScriptDriverTest/src/AxdbJavascriptDriverTest/`
- User requested to move to `~/TrelloLike` directory
- Created new directory structure

### 2. Files Created
1. **index.html** - Main HTML structure with semantic layout
2. **styles.css** - Complete styling with modern design and responsive layout
3. **script.js** - Full JavaScript functionality with TrelloBoard class
4. **README.md** - Comprehensive documentation of development steps
5. **CHAT_CONTEXT.md** - This file for future reference

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Core Functionality**: Add, edit, delete, and move cards between columns
- **Local Storage**: Automatic data persistence
- **Drag & Drop**: Visual card movement between columns
- **Modal Interface**: Clean UI for card editing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Security**: XSS protection with HTML escaping
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save, Escape to close
- **Developer Tools**: Console methods for data management

### 4. Technical Architecture
- **Class-based JavaScript**: TrelloBoard class with organized methods
- **Event-driven**: Comprehensive event handling system
- **Data Structure**: Clean JSON format stored in localStorage
- **Modern CSS**: Flexbox, gradients, animations, and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

## Context Information
- User's system: macOS
- Working directory context: JavaScript/Node.js development environment
- User familiar with Amazon internal development practices (Brazil build system, NPM packages with @amzn/ prefix)
- Development environment includes CodeArtifact and internal registries

## Future Extension Possibilities
Based on the conversation, potential areas for enhancement:
1. **Additional Features**: Due dates, priorities, labels, search/filter
2. **Multi-board Support**: Multiple project boards
3. **Cloud Sync**: Integration with AWS services for data persistence
4. **Collaboration**: Real-time updates and user management
5. **Advanced UI**: Better animations, themes, customization
6. **Mobile App**: React Native or PWA version
7. **Integration**: APIs for external services (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
8. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and productivity metrics

## Technical Considerations for Extensions
- Current architecture supports easy extension
- Modular class structure allows for feature additions
- Local storage can be replaced with cloud storage
- Event system supports additional functionality
- CSS architecture supports theming and customization

## Development Environment Notes
- User has access to Amazon internal tools and registries
- Familiar with Brazil build system and NPM package management
- Working in JavaScript/TypeScript development context
- Has experience with internal Amazon development practices
